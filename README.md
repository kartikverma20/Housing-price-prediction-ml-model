# üè† Boston Housing Price Prediction

## Overview

This project uses the **Boston Housing Dataset** to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. The dataset contains information on 506 neighborhoods in Boston, with 13 features capturing demographic, economic, and geographic aspects.

## Features

* **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town
* **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

* **LSTAT**: % lower status of the population

## Target

* **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s

## Objective

* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
* Build **regression models** to predict house prices.
* Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score.
